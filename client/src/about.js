            Often times, when we are stressed, we are unaware of the tension we hold in our hands, or
            lack the ability to alleviate it. With the MyoWare sensor, our system allows users to be notified when they
            are stressed based on the amount of tension held in their hands. The display of the measured data allows 
            users to receive a visual representation of what they are feeling, which encourages awareness of their stress.
